      "answer": "City might control the game due to their possession-based tactics, which forces turnovers in wide areas through press triggers on sideways passes (doc04). Additionally, City's dominant possession and high chance creation from half-spaces suggest they can maintain control with their high-intensity pressing (doc02). Furthermore, City's 3-2-4-1 formation allows for quick transitions via the left wing, which could be exploited by United if they can neutralize this aspect of City's game.",
